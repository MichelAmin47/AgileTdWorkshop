Feature: Receive confirmation when adding to cart

  As user of the webshop
  I would like to see a confirmation when I add products to my shopping cart
  So that I know that I added the right product


  Scenario: Receive confirmation when adding products to the shopping cart
    Given   I am on the Polteq Webshop
    When    I go to the IPODS page
    And     I go to the iPod Nano detail page
    And     I add the iPod Nano to the cart
    Then    I get a confirmation that the product is added to the shopping cart
    But     I should not be taken directly to my shopping cart


  Scenario: The Add to product to cart button is visible for each product on the homepage
    Given   I am on the Polteq Webshop
    And     The homepage displays products
    Then    I can see the add to cart button for each product


  Scenario: I can change the quantity of products added to the cart
    Given   I am on the Polteq Webshop
    When    I go to the IPODS page
    And     I go to the iPod Nano detail page
    And     I change the quantity to 4
    And     I add the iPod Nano to the cart
    Then    I get a confirmation that the set quantity of products are added to the cart


  Scenario: I can see if the item is in stock before I add the product to the cart
    Given   I am on the Polteq Webshop
    When    I go to the IPODS page
    And     I go to the iPod Nano detail page
